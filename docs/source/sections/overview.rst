Installation
------------


As Comet contains a fair amount of dependencies, it should be installed in a dedicated Python environment (e.g. `Conda <https://conda-forge.org/download>`_ or another environment manager of your choice) 
to avoid version conflicts. 

Comet runs on all major operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS), although development and testing are primarily conducted on Linux.
If you encounter any issues, please let us know via the `issue tracker <https://github.com/mibur1/comet/issues>`_.


.. code-block:: shell

    conda create -n comet python==3.11
    conda activate comet

Installation is then possible through the Python Package Index (PyPI) with the pip or pip3 command, depending on your system:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install comet-toolbox

Installation from the source code of this repository is also possible:

1. Download/clone the repository
2. Open a terminal in the folder which contains the pyproject.toml file
3. Install the package via pip (installing in editable mode (-e) is a helpful approach if you intend to modify the source code):

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -e .


Troubleshooting
...............

If you encounter errors regarding the matplotlib backend, you may need to install the following packages:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y libegl1-mesa libxkbcommon-x11-0
